# Programming-Theory-Project
Project created with Unity 2020.03

The project was created for the Programmering Theory chapter in the Unity: Junior Programmer pathway in order to utilize the four fundamentals of object-oriented programming.

It features a prototype character creation screen with customizable name, gender, race, class and alignment. Upon creating the character, a player character game object is created with the player's corresponding choices. The project also features classes for creating different characters as well as handling stats and stat modifiers for implementation and further development in other projects.
